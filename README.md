## Download
Lighthouse is published to `mavenCentral()`, so you can add it to your Android project like so:

```groovy
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	implementation("com.ivanempire.lighthouse:1.0.0")
}
```

Alternatively, you can manually download the AAR artifact from the [releases](https://github.com/ivanempire/lighthouse/releases) page.
